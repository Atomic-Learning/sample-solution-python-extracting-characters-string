<p>Let's perform a series of string operations step by step.</p>
<py-cell>
# Define your string
my_string = "python is so fun"
</py-cell>

<p>Extract and print the first character, the first three, and the last three characters.</p>
<py-cell>
first_char = my_string[0]
print(first_char)
first_three = my_string[:3] # Could also use my_string[0:3]
print(first_three)
last_three = my_string[-3:]
print(last_three)
</py-cell>

<p>Concatenate the first three and last three characters.</p>
<py-cell>
joined = first_three + last_three
print(joined)
</py-cell>

<p>Get every other character starting with the second character.</p>
<py-cell>
alternating = my_string[1::2]
print(alternating)
</py-cell>
